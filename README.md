# Tripwire
Welcome to heaven where Kotlin does not exist.

## What is this?
An travel tracker for traveling groups, for both family and friends. Not like you have any of those anyway.

## Who can use them?
Can you run apps on your phone?

## Why is it developed?
To make the world a better place. And make traveling a less of a pain in the ass.

## Can I join in the development?
Currently it's a college assignment. Depending on our mood, this may or may not be published in the real world.
